## 🎓 Analyzing School Performance Metrics

A Python-based tool to **analyze school performance** by calculating key metrics like student average scores, pass/fail status, class averages, pass percentages, and attendance. It also provides visualizations to make performance analysis easier. 📊

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze **student academic performance** across multiple subjects.
- Identify **class trends** in scores and attendance.
- Provide **visual insights** for teachers and school management.
- Help in **decision-making** for academic improvements.

---

## 📝 Features

- Calculate **average scores** for each student
- Determine **pass/fail** status based on thresholds
- Compute **class average, pass percentage, and attendance rate**
- Generate **bar charts** of student performance
- Export results to **CSV** for reporting
- Easy to **extend for large datasets** from CSV

## ⚙️ Setup & Initialization

  1️⃣ Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-performance-analysis.git
  cd school-performance-analysis
  2️⃣ Install dependencies
  bash
  Copy code
  pip install pandas matplotlib
  3️⃣ Run the analysis
  bash
  Copy code
  python school_performance_analysis.py
  4️⃣ View results
  Terminal will show individual student metrics and class-level metrics.

  Results will be saved in school_performance_metrics.csv.

  A bar chart of average student scores will be displayed.
-----

## ⚡ How It Works

 - Input data: Define student scores and attendance (can be expanded to CSV input).

 - Calculate metrics:

 - Student average scores

 - Pass/Fail status (threshold: 75)

  -Class average score

  -Class pass percentage

  -Average attendance

Visualize: Bar chart of average scores with pass threshold line.

Export: Results saved to CSV for reporting and record keeping.

## 🔮 Future Scope

 -Load large datasets from CSV or databases

 -Include subject-wise top performers and ranking

 -Analyze trends over multiple terms/years

 -Generate attendance vs performance correlation graphs

 -Build a web dashboard for interactive analysis
